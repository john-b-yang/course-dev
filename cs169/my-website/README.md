This is a personal website generator! All you have to do is fork this repo, edit `education.json` and `experience.json` and follow the instructions in `SETUP.md` to have your very own personal website that looks just like mine!

Features coming soon are multiple layouts you can easily toggle through with another `json` file and an executable to help those who have no coding experience create that `json` file!
