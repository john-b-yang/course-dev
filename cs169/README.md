# CS 169: Software Engineering
Course Site: BCourses (Available upon Enrollment)

I think CS 169 stands out as the most practical class amongst UC Berkeley EECS's other upper division courses. After previous internships, I initially took the class with a bit of skepticism. What could it teach me that I didn't already know?

Turns out, a lot. Other classes strengthened my coding chops, but CS 169 was the main class that taught how to code not just correctly, but also efficiently. It also looked at software development holistically, and I realized that I had only touched bits and pieces of the pipeline that goes into developing readable, maintainable, effective software.

I taught CS W169A from June 2020 to August 2020 as Head Instructor. During the months leading up, I had the incredible opportunity to work closely with [Prof. Armando Fox](http://www.armandofox.com/), along with an outstanding course staff. It has been my most formative teaching experience thus far.

Most of the material I've created for this class can be found at the Engineering Software as a Service [group](https://github.com/saasbook). This repository contains extracurricular material I made (i.e. workshop notes, presentations).
