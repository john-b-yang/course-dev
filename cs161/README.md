# CS 161: Computer Security
Course Site: https://cs161.org

We've all seen one form or another of a cliche Hollywood hacking scene where surreptitious perpetrators throw up their hands in wicked excitement, "I'm In!"

This repository is a collection of hands on demo's I wrote for UC Berkeley's CS 161 Computer Security course. I found, after taking the course, that revisiting some of the course concepts with practical applications gave my conceptual understanding a tangible example to reference. Each demo includes all the required code, along with a README, describing how to set up each demo and run each exploit for yourself.

I am a TA for the class for the Fall 2020 semester. If you are a student then, feel free to contact me by email (in course Piazza) with any questions about these demos. Otherwise, I'd appreciate a PR or Issue for this Github repo to communicate any issues.

Happy Hacking!
