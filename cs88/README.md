# CS 88: Computational Structures in Data Science
Course Site: https://cs88-website.github.io/

When UC Berkeley initiated the Data Science undergraduate degree program in 2018, the department was intent on ensuring the proposed curriculum equipped students in the major with a proficient technical foundation in Python.

I taught this course from August 2018 to December 2019, as a 2x TA and 1x Tutor, once under the department's interim dean Prof. David Culler. I created worksheets for the section of students I taught. The problems, solutions, and companion code are available per topic.

I noticed that sometimes, a frustrated individual working on a computer might be tempted to "spam" the autograding tool with a variety of half-baked solutions, in hopes of opportunely arriving at the right answer. On the other hand, existing worksheets from Berkeley's introductory [CS 61A](https://cs61a.org/) class were sometimes out of scope. While the two classes' teaching goals overlapped, they did not align well enough. I felt like these written problems were a good medium for verifying understanding within the scope of CS 88's topics.

Current CS 88 students, feel free to use these worksheets. For CS 88 staff interested in using these, please feel free to do so! If there's anything you'd like me to change, whether it's formatting or additional problems, please open a PR or issue on this repository.
